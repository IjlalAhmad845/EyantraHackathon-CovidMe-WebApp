# E-yantra-Hackathon - Covid Me - WebApp

## Title - Covid Me

## Description

> This **WebApp** helps people to find all their needs in one place whether it is **Covid cases data, cylinders data, medicines data or plasma data**. This open Source project unlocks uncountable opportunities to the people who wants to help this nation so that people who are in need of right information will get all in one place.


We have used **twitter API** to fetch the data from all over India and then filtered out that city wise so that there is easy understanding for users of how they get the information which is nearby them or any other location they want to.

The [WebApp](https://cov1dme.herokuapp.com/) comprises of three sections:-
- Realtime Covid data
- Find your Needs
- Graph

The First Section displays Total number of Active cases , Recovered Cases and Deaths along with daily data.

The Second section is the main highlight of this [WebApp](https://cov1dme.herokuapp.com/) where u can track whether a person is in need of **oxygen cylinders supply, Covid beds data ,Remdesivir or Plasma** all by city wise so that you can search your nearby area or any other city.

The last section is a graph which shows a previous **50 days** summary of **Total active cases** and **Recovered cases** in an interactive way.
>Note:- Both the data can be seen standalone from the graph.

## Hardware and Software requirements
### Hardware Requirements:-
We have not selected an **IOT or Embedded system based idea** because we want people of every class can be able to use this without spending a single penny from their pocket. As You know this is a [WebApp](https://cov1dme.herokuapp.com/), and nowadays everyone has a reach to own a Phone so you just need a Phone, PC or  any other device with a decent internet connection so u can access it anywhere. 

### Software Requirements:-
For a normal user, you just need a **Browser** to open it as a site and track all the necessary information on the go.
>We suggest chrome, mozilla firefox or edge.

From the diagram we can see when you select one of the four options from **Find your needs** section , the process will take you to the city selection page where you choose your desired city from where you want to fetch the information then it show all the relevant **tweets** from that city. The **Process Flow** further asks whether you want to fetch more tweets from the same city then it will refresh the page with new tweets.
For every Selection from the choices of Four you have to go back the **Home Screen**.
